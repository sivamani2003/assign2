## Frontend (Vite)

The frontend of this project is built using **Vite**. Vite is a fast and modern build tool that provides an optimized developer experience. The frontend communicates with the backend via API endpoints.

### Vite Project Details

1. **Development Server**: Vite provides hot-reloading and quick build times.
2. **Folder structure**:
    - `/src`: Source files for components, services, and store management.
    - `/public`: Public assets like images, favicon, etc.
  
**Scripts**:
- To start the development server:
```bash
  npm run dev
```

- To build the project for production:
```bash
  npm run preview
```

## Backend (Node.js)

The backend is built using **Node.js** and handles API requests. You can expand it to handle database connections, authentication, and more complex operations.

### Node.js Project Details

1. **API Framework**: The backend may use Express or another framework to route API requests.
2. **Folder Structure**:
    - `/controllers`: Contains controller files for handling requests.
    - `/routes`: Contains route definitions to handle different HTTP methods.
    - `/middleware`: Contains middleware for handling authentication, validation, etc.
  
**Scripts**:
- To start the backend server in development mode:
```bash
  npm start
```

- To start the server in production mode:
```bash
  npm run start
```

## Running the Project

1. Start the **Node.js** backend:

```bash
cd backend
npm start
```

2. Start the **Vite** frontend:

```bash
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

You should now be able to access the frontend at `http://localhost:5173` and the backend at `http://localhost:5003` (or whichever ports your backend and frontend are set to).
